# Terminal based Secure Private Chat app

Make sure that python 3.8 is installed on your device (the app is not compatible with python 3.9 due to unsupported libraries).

To run the chat application on your computer download the ```client``` folder and run ```python main.py``` (add ```sudo``` if you are using Linux) for the client.
It may return some errors about packages that are not installed, so you just enter:

```pip install -r requirements.txt``` (from the general ```chat``` folder)

Note that the app is meant for windows, so there can be some visual problems in Linux or other operating systems.

### *Optional:*
1. Create private group chats, i.e. Invite only
2. Create Public Chat rooms
