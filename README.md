# Terminal based Secure Private Chat app

To run the chat application on your computer download the client folder and run ```python main.py``` for the client. It may return some errors about packages that are not installed, so you can just type ```pip install X``` where X is the missing python package or ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` (or add ```sudo``` if you are using linux)

### TO DO:
1. Change chats src print i.e. ```[user]$~``` from client to server

### *Optional:*
1. Create private group chats, i.e. Invite only
2. Create Public Chat rooms
